Footballers in England is a three-page website divided into sections. The menu is fixed at the top to ensure easy navigation between pages.

#### Colors

The colors used in this project was acquired through the Love Running walkthrough project and also a basic white background.

#### Typography

The [Google Font Oswald+Lato](https://fonts.google.com/share?selection.family=Lato:ital,wght@1,300%7COswald:wght@300) was chosen as the main font with a fallback of Sans-Serif. Font weight of 300 have been used on the website.
